# liu-course-scraper

A simple program to parse the liu course data from, for example, https://liu.se/studieinfo/program/6cddd/3695.

Useful for doing some automating course chooser or simply importing into an excel sheet to more easily choose master courses and make sure they don't collide and that you actually achieve the specialisation requirements.

# Using

The following command

`py course-scraper.py https://liu.se/studieinfo/program/6cddd/3695`

will output the course info to a file called courses.csv.
